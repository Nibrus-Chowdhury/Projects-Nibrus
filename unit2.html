      <h1> Lesson #1 Welcome to the Internet</h1>
      <b>How do you use the Internet? Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes?
        What role does it have in your life?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>I am typically using internet everywhere for entertainment, classwork, or for gathering information. Internet
        plays an integral role in my life by allowing me to peruse my passions.</p>

      <h1> Lesson #2 Building a Network</h1>
      <b>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Person A can connect to Person D through B or E.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u3_Unit2">
      <h1> Lesson #3 The Need for Addressing</h1>
      <b>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</b>
      <hr>
      <p>The Internet Protocol breaks down information into packages and connects to a wide network of different IPs
        which designate the destination and sender of the information which allows two devices with IPs to connect to
        this network and communicate through the information sent in packages.</p>

    <div class="wave" id="u4_Unit2">
      <h1> Lesson #4 Routers and Redundancy</h1>
      <b>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building
        redundancy?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>The benefits of building redundancy into a network is that it makes for a fail-safe in case if one connection
        goes down then the network can still work. More connections means a higher demand which can slow down speeds or
        hurt overall efficiency for the cost of there being a fail-safe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u5_Unit2">
      <h1> Lesson #5 Packets</h1>
      <b>Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?</b>
      <hr>
      <p> D. Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u6_Unit2">
      <h1> Lesson #6 HTTP and DNS</h1>
      <b>What problem does the DNS solve? How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can
        access billions of web pages?</u></b>
      <hr>
      <p>DNS solves the problem of transforming domain names into IP addresses in order for many different computers to
        access the domain and this scales with more and more users because it is used by a connected network which can
        grow.</p>

      <h1> Lesson #7 Project Internet Dilemma</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This was the lesson for the creation of the Unit 2 project which is displayed to the right and during this project I learned a lot about the connection between technology and the real worl.</p>
