  <h1>My Pets</h1>

  <p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water
    every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>
<div id="dog_box">
  <h2>Lula</h2>

  <h4>Dog</h4>
  <img src="Puppy.jpg" alt="Dog Image">
  <p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with. I like to take her to the park. Her favorite
    toy is an old tennis ball.</p>
</div>
  <h2>Slowpoke</h2>

  <h4>Turtle</h4>
  <img src="Turtle.jpg" alt="Turtle Image">
  <p>Slowpoke is my turtle. I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10
    because I promised to take care of him.</p>

  <h2>Hamster</h2>

  <h4>Fish</h4>
  <img src="Fish.jpg" alt="Fish Image">
  <p>Hamster is the name of my fish. I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him
    anyway. He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
