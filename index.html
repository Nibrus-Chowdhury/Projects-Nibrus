        <p><b>Summary:</b> CGI is, now more than ever, more prominently being used to digitally make dead actors come to
          life in film which has a dilemma. Does the actor consent to this use of their character and can we make that
          judgment without them? There have been many theories floating around but no decisive answer thus far. This
          could be used to fake videos much easier as well.</p>

        <a href="html/Article2_NBA-Case.html">Article 2: Copyright Case of Tattoos in Games</a>
        <p><b>Summary:</b> NBA 2K made by the company Take-Two included tattoos in their game without explicitly
          permission by tattoo artists who claim it to be copyright. The defense for Take-Two is that their license from
          the NBA says that they can create avatars that are real to the players they represent and that technically
          includes the tattoos. The tattoo artist's claim is that the license does not explicitly allow for Take-Two to
          use their copyrighted art without any representation. Needless to say, Take-Two have won the case with their
          defense.</p>

        <p><b>Summary:</b> There are many benefits to digitizing DNA. It can help medical professions and scientists to
          develop medicine, help people learn more about their family, help the police solve cases, and help with
          identification. However, there are also many disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that with easy access to
          information with minimal encryption/security, cybercriminals can hack and use this information for fraudulent
          purposes such as ransom, framing people in crimes, and tampering with evidence.</p>

        <p style="margin-inline-start: 300px; margin-inline-end: 300px;">What our group learned as a whole is that for a
          website to work propely everyone needs to communicate and contribute equally and respectfully or else chaos
          occurs. A few times in our work we were chaotic but we pulled ourselves back together to finally finish the
          website.</p>
