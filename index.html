  <p id="paragraph">I learned many new commands in JavaScript as well as how to make a function. The function is especially crucial because it allows for a set of code to be written with in the function which can then be used to call that code anytime in my code. I also learned the button command for users to add input and get an output from the website. Additionally, I also learned how to add id to elements in order to recall them later which I feel is a fundimental concept that can be used as a beginner and advanced programmer.</p>
