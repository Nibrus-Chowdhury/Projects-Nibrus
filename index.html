    <p>Blueberry Muffins are one of the most beloved baked goods someone can make because not only does everyone universally like it but it's also extremely easy to make! Make these at a party and you will never have any worries about people not enjoying the food, but be sure you have enough because people might be craving a little too many muffins.</p>

   <h2 style="font-family: calibri; font-size: 45px; font-style: italic;">Method:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Stock up on 1 pint of fresh blueberries, then wash, drain, and pick them over. That means remove any straggler stems and toss any wrinkly or damaged berries.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and prepare a muffin pan with cupcake liners.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, sift together 2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt then set it aside.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs until smooth. Add the 1/2 cup melted butter, milk, and vanilla, and whisk until combined.</li>
      <li>Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir until combined then mix in the blueberries.</li>
      <li>To prepare the streusel topping, in a medium bowl combine 1/4 cup flour, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, cinnamon, and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Using a pastry cutter, cut in butter until topping is crumbly and coarse.
</li>
      <li>Place muffin batter inside muffin pan and place about 1 tablespoon streusel topping on each individual muffin in pan.</li>
      <li>Bake until muffin centers bounce back when lightly pressed, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool muffins on a rack for several minutes before removing from pan. Cool completely and store in an airtight container, up to 4 days.
</li>
    </ol>
