      <b>Unit 1</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Unit 1 was a large unit with many topics addressed with the most important being HTML Code/Syntax, how computers display and use Binary, image abstraction, and copyright laws. Firstly, we learned many HTML commands such as h1 and /h1 for a heading or ol and /ol for an ordered list with which we created a website with basic information about ourselves. Next we learned some foundational information on how computers display information with 1s and 0s by having them in specific orders like orders of 8 to create a bit for numbers to display. After, we learned about image abstraction with the layers going digital image, sampling, pixel, and finally binary and this is how images are shown on a computer screen. Compression was also brought up to show how data can be compressed to reduce file size for easier transfer. Finally, we went over copyright laws with creative commons being the body to distribute licenses for the right of users to gain certain permissions to creative works.</p>

      <b>Unit 2</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Unit 2 was a relatively short unit but it had a central topic of data transfer between computers. Data is sent through paths between notes of different computers and the bandwidth can determine the traffic for information to be transferred, this is because bandwidth is the amount of data being transferred in a given time period. Internet protocols are used to package the data and send it off to a different IP address. A DNS server can translate domain names into IP addresses with HTTP links used to send information to your computer and load a page full of data to your computer. The internet is effectively a connected system of computers that can send data to each other with routers often being used as middle men to forward the data to the desired destination.</p>

      <b>Unit 3</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Unit 3 was also short with a focus on JavaScript and app development in which we learned coding principles and design principles. The actions that users do in order to interact with an app is called an input and what the code does as a result is the output. A clear user interface must be present for the user to interact with said app and gain information. Sequential programs go off of order and event based programs go off of onEvent commands that look for user input in the app or website.

      <b>Unit 4</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Unit 4 was a large unit that introduced more JavaScript concepts with increasingly complicated apps with the use of variables and functions. Variables are storages for one piece of information and they are named to usually match their function. Going into functions, functions are multiple commands inside a function command which can be called upon if it isn't inside anything else and is declared. If other commands notice IF a condition has been met and it does the following code or if the condition is not met then the else code goes. Conditionals can be made through comparison operators and logical operators to test, per say, if something is greater than another thing. Also boolean values are true of false values which can only be true or false.</p>
