      <p>A favicon is an image that is displayed to represent the site you have open. I created my favicon through google sheets squares and took a screenshot in order to incorporate into my sites. In order to add a favicon to this page we need the link tag with the attribute "rel" which means relation that we will be declaring for the link and we set that to icon because we want the favicon to be an icon for our page and then we declare the type of format the file is. Then we hyper reference address of the file and that adds a favicon to our site.</p>
