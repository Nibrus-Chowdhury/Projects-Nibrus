      <h1>Lesson #1 Welcome to CSP</h1>
      <b>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to
        the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>My personal method is to take notes in an app at home to help me remember the information and keep reviewing it
        for 2-3 days, so I know a hundred percent of it. This is pretty similar to the ones I heard about from the
        students because from the students I learned that this class goes a bit fast and to learn best we need to focus
        on class and then take some time to absorb the information properly at home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u2_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #2 Representing Information</h1>
      <b>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two
        options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Modifying our device to represent more options makes the device overly complicated and not as compact.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u3_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #3 Circle Square Patterns</h1>
      <b>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>I would explain a number system to someone who has never seen numbers before by telling them that it represents
        something real first, like the amount of something there is and through this we can create different systems to
        represent different things.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u4_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #4 Binary Numbers</h1>
      <b>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>A binary system uses two digits, a 1 and a 0, hence the prefix bi. These two digits in certain sequences
        display information whereas a decimal system with the prefix dec means 10 and that is why our decimal system
        which we are used to has ten digits to represent numbers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u5_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #5 Overflow and Rounding</h1>
      <b>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car
        drives beyond its maximum reading?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>The odometer resets to the beginning of the counting of miles driven.</p>
      <b>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>No you cannot create all possible fractions because there are too many fractions to represent in bits and
        repeating fractions are also hard to represent.</p>
    </div>

      <h1> Lesson #6 C.F.U</h1>

      <hr>
      <p>The Answer</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u7_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #7 Black and White Images</h1>
      <b>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample
        the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use?
        How would your decision affect the digital representation?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>I would sample the image with 256 bit sample size to get a good digital approximation without too much time
        being taken and this decision affects the digital representation by how sharp it turns out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u8_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #8 Color Images</h1>
      <b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color
        image.</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Binary sequences are used in order to represent either a red or green or blue pixel. There are many of these
        pixels on a screen display which means there is a lot of sampling to create detailed images from these sequences
        of binary to RGB to finally display and output to a digital color image.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u9_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #9 Lossless Compression</h1>
      <b>If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>If I could talk to the author then I would tell them that their email is having a lossless compression which
        means that after being sent the email, it will be back to original since it is being reconstructed with no loss.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u10_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #10 Lossy Compression</h1>
      <b>Youâ€™ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages,
        images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of
        these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>Lossless compression:<br>
        - Text messages because text needs to have all the characters for it to make sense so if there is loss then that
        text message has no value.<br>

        Lossy Compression: All this data can be compressed with some loss because the human senses cannot detect a small
        amount of quality drop.<br>
        - Images<br>
        - Video<br>
        - Music</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u11_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #11 Intellectual Property</h1>
      <b>Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be
        okay?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>The person who took the image and sold it would need to make sure the image had a redistribution for commercial
        sale creative commons license so that their selling of it without credit was valid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u12_Unit1">
      <h1> Lesson #12 Project Digital Information Dilemmas</h1>
      <b>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</b>
      <hr>
      <p>We should care about information being represented digitally because this type of information is just as valid
        as non-digital representation of information which would mean that it should be under some rules that restrict
        people from abusing this information. This can impact anyone that makes or stores information digitally because
        anyone else can take the information for their benefit with your hard work which is unfair and unjust.</p>
