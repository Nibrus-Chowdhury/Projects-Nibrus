    <b>Unit 4 - Variables, Conditionials, and Functions</b>

  </div>
  <div id="left">
    <div class="wave" id="u1_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #1 Variables Explore</h1>
      <b>What will the value of score be at the end of the program?</b>
      <p>The value of score at the end of the program will be "The score is: 4"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u2_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #2 Variables Investigate</h1>
      <b>Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?</b>
      <p>The variable has a value that it is set to and once the event has occurred the value is updated in the form of adding one to the existing value and so the number increases which is the counter pattern.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u3_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #3 Variables Practice</h1>
      <b>What will be displayed after this code segment is run?</b>
      <p>After this code segment is run, myPoints will display the value of 6.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u4_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #4 Variables Make</h1>
      <p>In this lesson we had to create the photo liker App with functionality for likes and dislikes as well as commenting for which we had to mkae from sratch but the elements were already present.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u5_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #5 Conditionals Explore</h1>
      <b>Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?</b>
      <p>With the conditions that we have been given we cannot make a "maybe" answer because computers need to be specific but I imagine we can somehow create a maybe answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u6_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #6 Conditional Investigate</h1>
      <b>When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below. What does it mean to put the most specific case first? Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?</b>
      <p>You should always make your first conditon the most specific because the computer runs the code form top to bottom and if you have the most specific conditions anywhere but the top then it can create bugs in which the code doesn't recognize the most specific case.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u7_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #7 Conditionals Pratice</h1>
      <b>What will be displayed after this code segment is run?</b>
      <p>After this code segment is run the terminal will display "You Win!".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u8_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #8 Conditionals Make</h1>
      <p>This lesson we created the Museum Ticket Generator App in which we used conditionals to create the dollar amount for a ticket when the users selects certain settings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u9_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #9 Functions Explore / Investigate</h1>
      <b>In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?</b>
      <p>Creating functions allows you to be more organized in your code and reduce repetition that is unnecessary which makes the code faster since it is more efficient.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u10_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #10 Functions Practice</h1>
      <b>What will be displayed after this code segment is run</b>
      <p>After the code segment runs it will display "School Day"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u11_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #11 Functions Make</h1>
      <p>In this lesson we created the quote maker app which allows you to write a quote with decorations and the main focus was using functions to make the code more neat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u12_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #12 Decision Maker App</h1>
      <p>The decision maker app was the cumulation of all the previous lessons combined to create an app that makes decisions for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u13_Unit4">
      <h1> Lesson #13 Assessment Day</h1>
      <p>This was a cumulative assessment on functions, conditionals, and variables in order to test our understanding of the Unit as well as the topic thus far.</p>
