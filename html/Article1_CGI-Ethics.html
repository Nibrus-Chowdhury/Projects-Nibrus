                <p style="font-size: 22px;"> Scenes in movies are being digitized. These scenes would usually be recorded with the use of a camera, but with technological advancements and the use of CGI, many things are achievable such as bringing fictional worlds and dead actors back into scenes. </p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 50%; border: solid;">
                <p style="font-size: 22px;">The purpose of digitizing this person is because movies need recurring characters but if the person is not alive then we either have to digitize them or add a brand new character out of nowhere.
                From this situation the film company is likely benefitting from digitizing their characters but the person who is dead might also benefit by being immortal in a sense.</p>

              <h2>What are the benefits and harms of digitizing this content?</h2>

            </th>
            <tr>
              <td style="border: solid;">
                <p style="font-size: 22px;"> The benefits of digitizing this content is the appeal it gives to a film's fanbase. The use of CGI can create beautiful scenes without having a stage setup to capture it on. It can also have dead actors through a series to keep it realistic. This also benefits film production companies as it can increase their revenue. However, the actorâ€™s family can be harmed and just ethical values in general because now that the actor is dead, they cannot consent to using images of themselves to generate revenue. Moreover, it can harm people because it raises a lot of controversies on this topic. </p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 50%; border: solid;">
                <p style="font-size: 22px;"> For the most part, the world is better due to digital representation. Technological advancements such as the use of CGI can create hyperrealistic scenery or completely fictional scenes with dead actors in it by using computers rather than going through the tedious process of capturing live and staging a whole scene using props. However, small controversies such as the realism behind scenes and the ethics concerning bringing dead actors back to life still arise.</p>
