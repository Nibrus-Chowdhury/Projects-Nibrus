                <p style="font-size: 22px;">DNA can be digitized and stored in a database. DNA is represented digitally by the decoding and encoding of binary data from and to strands of DNA that are synthesized.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 22px;">Digitizing DNA benefits people in many ways such as aiding in medical and scientific research, or for uncovering ancestral background. For example, digitized DNA can help find the cure to a disease. The easy access is a threat as hackers can get their hands on private information and tamper with it. Stolen DNA can be used to incriminate someone, it can be used as something to pay a ransom for, and it tampers with evidence. On top of that, cybercriminals can use vulnerabilities of computers to hack and decline access to certain information without being paid a sum of money.</p>
              </td>
              <td style="width: 50%; border: solid;">
                <p style="font-size: 22px;"> In the long run, I feel that our world is better due to digital representation. Information becomes easy to access and more organized. On top of that, things like DNA samples can be accessed digitally from anywehre at anytime when digitized. However, there are always drawbacks. Cybercriminals can breach into sensitive information and can do many things with this. To improve the digitization of things, I would put strong encryption and have a team that works to protect agaisnt breaches.</p>
