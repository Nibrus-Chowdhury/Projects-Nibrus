This information is being represented digitally through the avatars with in the NBA 2K games upon whom Take-Two have put the designated players tattoos.</p>

The concept of the game is that it is a real recreation of the players in the NBA all the way down to the select tattoos on their avatars.</p>

This of course does come at the cost of having a weird zone of what's actually allowed to be digitally represented.</p>
