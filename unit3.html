      <h1> Lesson #1 Introduction to Apps</h1>
      <b>Match term with the example</b>
      <p>Input = The user clicks a button
        <br>
        Output = A song is played
        <br>
        User Interface = A screen with buttons, images, and text
      </p>

    <div class="wave" id="u2_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #2 Introduction to Design Mode</h1>
      <b>Why is it important for element IDs to have meaningful names?</b>
      <p>It's important for element IDs to have meaningful names because without meaningful names the element IDs are hard to identify.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u3_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #3 Designing an App Part 1</h1>
      <p> This lesson delved into the UI side of designing an app in which we put the necessary elements needed to design the App for later use. </p>

    <div class="wave" id="u4_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #4 The Need for Programming Languages</h1>
      <b>What is the difference between a programming language and natural (every-day) language?</b>
      <p>The difference between a programming language and a natural language is that we use a natural language to communicate with each other but we use a programming language to communicate with a computer which makes the language harder to learn. Computers don't understand the conventions of natural languages as they don't have brains but run on very specific commands whereas  natural languages do not require or have too much specificity.</p>

    <div class="wave" id="u5_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #5 Intro to Programming</h1>
      <b>What is the difference between a sequential program and an event-driven program?</b>
      <p>A sequential program happens automatically one after the other through lines of code but an event waits for a haptic to happen for it to run the code and it checks for the haptic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wave" id="u6_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #6 Debugging</h1>
      <b>What is one thing you really enjoyed about today's activity? Is there anything that you found confusing or need extra help with?</b>
      <p>One thing I really enjoyed about today's activity is that catching other peoples mistakes made me aware of mistakes I was not even aware of so that when I eventually have to debug my program I am aware to search for those problems. I sometimes found the URL to places confusing since it is such a long string of text and many things can go wrong in importing an image.</p>

    <div class="wave" id="u7_Unit3">
      <h1> Lesson #7 Designing an App Part 2</h1>
      <p>This lesson we designed the code for our App with onEvents to watch for user input and output something.</p>
